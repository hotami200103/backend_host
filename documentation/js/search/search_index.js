(\\`.hbs\\` files): Handlebars templates for generating documentation pages\n- **Styles** (\\`.css\\` files): Stylesheets for customizing the appearance\n- **Scripts** (\\`.js\\` files): JavaScript files for additional functionality\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Extract this ZIP file to a directory on your system\n2. Use the \\`--templates\\` flag when running Compodoc to specify the path to your custom templates:\n\n   \\`\\`\\`bash\n   compodoc -p tsconfig.json --templates ./path/to/custom/templates/\n   \\`\\`\\`\n\n## Template Structure\n\n- \\`page.hbs\\` - Main page template\n- \\`partials/\\` - Directory containing partial templates\n- \\`styles/\\` - Directory containing CSS files\n- \\`js/\\` - Directory containing JavaScript files\n\n## Customization Tips\n\n1. **Templates**: Use Handlebars syntax to customize the HTML structure\n2. **Styles**: Modify CSS to change colors, fonts, layout, etc.\n3. **Scripts**: Add custom JavaScript functionality\n\n## Backup\n\nAlways keep a backup of your original templates before making changes.\n\n## Documentation\n\nFor more information about customizing Compodoc templates, visit:\nhttps://compodoc.app/guides/template-customization.html\n\nGenerated by Compodoc Template Playground\n`;\n  }\n\n  private downloadBlob(blob: Blob, filename:

Check out the deployment documentation for more information.\nIf you are looking for a cloud-based platform to deploy your NestJS application, check out Mau, our official platform for deploying NestJS applications on AWS. Mau makes deployment straightforward and fast, requiring just a few simple steps:\nExample :$ npm install -g @nestjs/mau\n$ mau deployWith Mau, you can deploy your application in just a few clicks, allowing you to focus on building features rather than managing infrastructure.\nResources\nCheck out a few resources that may come in handy when working with NestJS:\n\nVisit the NestJS Documentation to learn more about the framework.\nFor questions and support, please visit our Discord channel.\nTo dive deeper and get more hands-on experience, check out our official video courses.\nDeploy your application to AWS with the help of NestJS Mau in just a few clicks.\nVisualize your application graph and interact with the NestJS application in real-time using NestJS Devtools.\nNeed help with your project (part-time to full-time)? Check out our official enterprise support.\nTo stay in the loop and get updates, follow us on X and LinkedIn.\nLooking for a job, or have a job to offer? Check out our official Jobs board.\n\nSupport\nNest is an MIT-licensed open source project. It can grow thanks to the sponsors and support by the amazing backers.

setup (reproducible)\nTo make it easy for other machines to pull and run this backend, follow these steps.\n\nCopy environment example and adjust if needed:\n\nExample :copy .env.example .env\nStart a local Postgres (recommended: Docker Compose):\n\nExample :docker compose up -d  This will start Postgres on localhost:5432 with database BlueMoon, user postgres, and password 123456 (matches .env.example).\n\nInstall Node dependencies and run the backend setup (generates Prisma client, pushes schema, and seeds demo data):\n\nExample :cd backend\nnpm run setup  If you don't have Python dependencies installed for the seed script, install them first:\nExample :pip install -r requirements.txt\nStart the dev server:\n\nExample :npm run start:devNow the backend should be available at http://localhost:3000 and seeded demo accounts exist (see seed output for credentials).\nIf you prefer not to use Docker, ensure a PostgreSQL instance is running and update .env accordingly.\n#
